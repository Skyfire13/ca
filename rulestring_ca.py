# Life-like CA generator that generates cellular automata through rulestrings
# A rulestring is the notation symbolizing which cells will be born, which
# cells will survive, and which cells will die moving into the next iteration.
#
# Rulestring Format(Birth/Survival Notation):
#
# B23S15
#
# Any numbers following the "B" represent the amount of neighbors an empty
# cell must have for the cell to turn active in the next generation
# Any numbers following the "S" represent the amount of neighbors a living
# cell must have to survive to the next generation
# Any cell that is covered by the birth/survival notation dies moving into
# the next generation.
